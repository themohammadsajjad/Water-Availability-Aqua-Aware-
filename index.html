                    <h3>Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
                    <p>Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the practice of collecting and storing rainwater for later use. It's a water conservation method that can help reduce the demand on groundwater and surface water, and improve water quality.</p>

                    <h3>Groundwater</h3>
                    <p>Groundwater is water that is stored underground in the soil or in the cracks and pores of rocks. It is a renewable resource that is formed when rain or other precipitation seeps into the ground and fills the spaces in the soil and rocks.</p>

            <h2>Water Conservation</h2>
            <p><b>What Is Water Conservation?</b>
                <br>
                Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage. According to Fresh Water Watch, water conservation is important because fresh clean water is a limited resource, as well as a costly one. As a homeowner, you’re probably already well aware of the financial costs of inefficient water use. Conservation of this natural resource is critical for the environment — and our wallets.</p>
